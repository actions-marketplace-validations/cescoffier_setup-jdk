# setup-jdk

This action sets up a Java development environment with the OpenJDK distribution from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for use in actions by:

- Downloading and caching a version of the OpenJDK by version and adding to `PATH`. Downloads from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Registering problem matchers for error output.

The action is based on [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) and is using the [AdoptOpenJDK API](https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/) for fetching the JDK binaries. It's also a fork from 
https://github.com/joschi/setup-jdk, trying to improve the reliability.
